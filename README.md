This program analyzes possible appearance of train accidents.

**Design decisions**
Length of way is an integer. There are single bidirectional tracks between stations.
There is no circle motion, but train drivers are hooligans and sometimes reverse motion
could be given.
Station and train are presented as a point.
Name of station should consist of letters.
Every section of railway has name that consist of start name point and end name point, sorted
in lexicographical order. There is no waiting time for trains, so, for example B.arrival =
B.departure.
Traffic Service has a railway configuration and makes the overall timetable. Overall timetable
consist of shedules for every section of railway.
